üö® Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning
This project is a hands-on implementation of a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python. It was developed as part of a learning journey into cybersecurity and data science, specifically focused on detecting network intrusions using classification techniques on the NSL-KDD dataset.

This project helped me gain practical experience in:

Cybersecurity Concepts

Understanding what constitutes an "intrusion" in network security.

Exploring the architecture and role of IDS in securing networks.

Data Science Workflow

Data loading and preprocessing for real-world cybersecurity datasets.

Feature selection and dimensionality reduction.

Building and evaluating machine learning models for anomaly detection.

Machine Learning Techniques

Supervised classification (Binary classification of normal vs. attack).

Training and evaluating different classifiers:

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes

Performance metrics:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

Tools and Libraries Used

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas, numpy for data manipulation

scikit-learn for machine learning models and preprocessing

matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization

üìÅ Dataset Used
NSL-KDD Dataset:

A refined version of the KDD‚Äô99 dataset for evaluating IDS models.

Contains labeled network traffic data with various types of known attacks (DoS, Probe, U2R, R2L).

Loaded and analyzed both training (KDDTrain+.txt) and testing (KDDTest+.txt) sets.

üõ†Ô∏è Main Project Features
‚úÖ Data Preprocessing:

Handled categorical to numerical conversion using Label Encoding.

Normalized feature values using MinMaxScaler.

Filtered out irrelevant features and engineered the dataset for performance.

üîç Exploratory Data Analysis:

Distribution of attack types vs. normal traffic.

Visualized correlation heatmaps of features.

üìà Model Training & Evaluation:

Split training/testing data for cross-validation.

Built multiple classifiers to compare their effectiveness.

Plotted confusion matrices and evaluated performance reports for each model.

üìä Results & Insights
Identified which algorithms are more effective for IDS.

Found that some models like Random Forest and Decision Tree performed better than others in terms of accuracy and F1-score.

Learned how preprocessing and feature selection can drastically affect IDS model performance.

üí° Future Improvements
Implement deep learning approaches (e.g., LSTM or CNN for sequential data).

Try ensemble methods for improved detection accuracy.

Use real-time packet sniffing and integrate with live traffic using tools like Scapy or Wireshark.

üìö Conclusion
This project allowed me to bridge the gap between cybersecurity concepts and machine learning techniques. It strengthened my understanding of how data-driven systems can be developed to detect malicious activity in networks. Through this project, I‚Äôve gained practical experience in working with security datasets, building classification models, and evaluating their real-world effectiveness.
